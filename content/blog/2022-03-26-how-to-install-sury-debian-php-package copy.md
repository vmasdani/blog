Run this in your command line, as per the instruction in the [wiki](https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-to-enable-the-debsuryorg-repository):

```sh
curl -sSL https://packages.sury.org/php/README.txt | sudo bash -x
```

And that's it, you're done!  

Other guides complicate this process so much it does not make sense, just enter that command and you're good to go. Happy coding!
