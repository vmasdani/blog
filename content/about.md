## Hello, folks!
My name is Valian Masdani. I am a full time software developer in an Indonesian company with lots of interest on the field of web, mobile, embedded devices, and internet of things.    

I use Typescript, React, Kotlin, and Spring Boot for my daily work, but currently my favorite programming languages are Rust, Golang, Dart/Flutter, and Elm. I am currently investing a lot in these languages, so expect some news in my [Apps](/apps) page.
