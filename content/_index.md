## Hello, this is Valian Masdani's homepage.

This site mainly has some programming tutorials, open source stuff, and my opinions.  
If you are interested about the contents of my blog, go [check it out](/blog).  
Or else if you want to find out more about me, check out my [about](/about) page.  
Or else if you want to view my open-sourced apps, check out my [apps](/apps) page.  

<!-- This is a simple dev blog that I made [for my website](https://bennetthardwick.com).
It's quite easy to install, just go to the [project page](https://github.com/bennetthardwick/simple-dev-blog-zola-starter) and follow the prompts.

This template does some fancy stuff like [pre-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content) blog posts and nav links,
pre-fetching your profile image and adding a bunch of common meta tags.

If you're still making up your mind, feel fee to take a look around by clicking the [about](/about/) and [blog](/blog/) nav links. -->
